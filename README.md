You will need to include in this repository:
- `major1.txt` contains the courses a student needs to take to fulfill one major
- `major2.txt` contains the courses a student needs to take to fulfill another major
- The source code of your program

# Creating a Flowchart from a Dependency List
A work by: Bosena Telila and Kyle Telnes

*Write an introduction to your work*
Welcome to our flowchart repo. This project aims to help incoming first-year students visualize the classes they will be taking. Often, first-year students coming into college do not know what classes they need to take and in what order they need to take them. This project helps students see what classes they need to take based on their chosen major.


## Description
*Describe what your project is about and what language you used*
This project aims to help students, more specifically freshmen visualize the classes they need to takeâ€”one of the first things students have to do after choosing their major is plan their course load. Sometimes figuring out what class you need to take in what order can be overwhelming. There are so many classes to take over 12 the next 12 quarters. With our code, students can specify the quarter they will be starting in along with the maximum credits they are willing to take. With the student's preferences set, our code takes in a list of classes and visualizes how the courses should be taken based on the selected major.  

We are using Python 3.1 as our programing language. Python is a super powerful and easy-to-learn programing language. Along with Python, we are using the latest version Igraph 0.9.9 as our graphing library. Igraph is a reletively new graphing library that is used to graph networks. 

## Requirements
*The requirements of the program, i.e. Python 3.1, what libraries are needed*
Some of the libraries you need to install are igraph and cario.
Make sure you have the latest Python installed on your machine as well as Homebrew. 

- `pip3 install igraph`
- `brew install cairo`

## User Manual
*Once a person clones this into their computer how the person is supposed to run the program, add screenshots showing how your program works, also add here the link to the Youtube video showing the program running*
After cloning our repo you should do the following things.

1. Make sure you have the above libararies insatalled on your local machine
2. Run the main.py file using `python3 main.py1`
3. The console will prompt you to choose a major. If you selected 1 -> BA - Computer Science the file selected is major1.txt
4. Next the console will prompt you to enter the maximum number of credits. 
5. Finally the console will prompt you to select the starting quarter.

## Reflection
*Write the reflection about getting the small groups in the minimum number of iterations, etc.*
